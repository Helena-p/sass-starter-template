# Starter template using Dart Sass

Built using Vite as build tool with the Vite PurgeCss plug-in to reduce compiled CSS file size and unused selectors.<br>
This starter template is intended for static MPAs (Multi Page Application), however, to tailor for a SPA (Single Page Application) modify <code>vite.config.js</code> file to your need.<br>
To demonstrate setup for pretty URLs, two pages are included (About, Contact) in addition to the <code>index.html</code> main file.

## How to use template
Depending on your needs, select the green button *Use this template* in the top right corner of the [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/Helena-p/sass-starter-template), and choose either *Create new repository* or *Open in a codespace*.<br>
For option *Create new repository*, on local machine, install necessary dependencies with <code>npm install</code>.
