# Starter template using Dart Sass & Vite build tool

Built using Vite as build tool with Vite PurgeCss plug-in to reduce copiled CSS file size and unused selectors.<br>
This starter template is intended for static MPAs (Multi Page Application), however, to tailor for a SPA (Single Page Application) modify <code>vite.config.js</code> file to your need.<br>
To demonstrate setup for pretty URLs, two pages are included (About, Contact) in addition to the <code>index.html</code> default file.
